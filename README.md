4. Set up Spotify API credentials:
   - Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Create a new app and note the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
   - Add the redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
   - Save your credentials in a `.env` file in the root directory of this app:

     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
     ```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Application

node index.js --mode cli --url <spotify-or-youtube-url>
```

> NOTE: This app has two modes, cli and server. Server mode is still not fully implemented. Use cli only for now

### 2. Examples

  ```bash
  node index.js --mode cli --url https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4nT7b2XU4sVWp8Rt7A6WqI
  ```

- Download a YouTube playlist:
  ```bash
  node index.js --mode cli --url https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv9ZK9k7ZDjW5mDlMQm4eMjR4kxY9e8Ji
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Spotify Token:**
  - Ensure your `.env` file contains valid Spotify API credentials.
  - Clear the token file (`TOKENFILE`) and reauthenticate.

- **YouTube Download Issues:**
  - Verify `yt-dlp` is installed and accessible.
